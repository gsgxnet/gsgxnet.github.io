# Ulysses by James Joyce, a great book

From Enc Brit:  
Ulysses, novel by Irish writer James Joyce, first published in book form in 1922. 
Stylistically dense and exhilarating, it is generally regarded as a masterpiece and has been the subject of numerous volumes of commentary and analysis. 
The novel is constructed as a modern parallel to Homerâ€™s Odyssey.
    
A long read I would say
